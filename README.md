Bep20 Development - Developing stronger, faster blockchain applications

Bep20 Token was developed as part of an ongoing economic and analytical study of the behavior of cryptocurrency smart-contracts, their uses, capabilities, and security vulnerabilities. Our aim is to serve as an open case study for people to understand cryptocurrency; how to use it, it's benefits, as well as its risks. Hopefully, this leads to wider adoption by public and private organizations alike. Our development team consists of data scientists, programmers, economists, and cyber security professionals. Though there are no known vulnerabilities in the BEP20 contract, we openly invite like-minded individuals to try and hack our Binance Smart-Chain TestNet address as a part of our bug-bounty program which ultimately helps us continue to serve our customers, current and future, to the best abilities available in the world today. To participate professionally for compensation, please contact us prior to any funny-business. Enroll on our website at Bep20.dev to participate.
